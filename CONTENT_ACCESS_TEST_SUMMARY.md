# Content Management and Access Control Testing Summary

## Overview

Successfully expanded the Direct-to-Fan Platform test coverage to include comprehensive content management and access control testing. This expansion adds critical validation for the platform's core value proposition: secure, tier-based content distribution.

## New Test Suites Added

### 1. Content Management Integration Tests
**File**: `src/__tests__/content-management-integration.test.ts`  
**Tests**: 18 passing  
**Focus**: End-to-end content lifecycle and business logic

#### Key Scenarios Covered:
- **File Upload Flow**: S3 presigned URL generation, file validation, and upload success/failure
- **Content Creation**: Artist content creation with tier assignment and validation
- **Access Control**: Public vs. gated content authorization patterns
- **Content Discovery**: Filtering, pagination, and search functionality
- **CRUD Operations**: Content updates, metadata changes, and secure deletion
- **Multi-tier Content**: Complex tier assignments and accessibility rules
- **Engagement Tracking**: View and download analytics with business metrics

#### Business Logic Validation:
- Tier ownership verification prevents unauthorized content assignment
- File type and size validation protects against malicious uploads
- Content type determination from file format
- Artist authorization for content management operations
- Business metrics tracking for all content interactions

### 2. Access Control Security Tests
**File**: `src/__tests__/access-control-simplified.test.ts`  
**Tests**: 27 passing  
**Focus**: Security, authorization, and edge case handling

#### Security Scenarios Covered:
- **Authentication Patterns**: Public content, owner access, subscription-based access
- **Token Security**: JWT generation, verification, and expiration handling
- **Tier Access Control**: Subscription validation and tier-based permissions
- **Content Filtering**: User-specific content accessibility
- **Data Protection**: Access summaries without cross-user data leakage
- **Edge Cases**: Malicious input handling, concurrent access, cross-artist validation

#### Authorization Validation:
- Public content accessible to all authenticated users
- Artists can always access their own content regardless of subscription status
- Subscription-based access correctly enforced for gated content
- Expired subscriptions properly deny access
- Cross-artist permissions validated to prevent unauthorized access

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive Mock Infrastructure
- **S3 Integration Mocks**: File upload validation and presigned URL generation
- **Content Access Function Mocks**: Complete tier-based access control system
- **JWT Token Mocks**: Secure token generation and verification
- **Database Operation Mocks**: Content CRUD operations with proper error handling

### 2. Business Logic Integration
- **Metrics Tracking**: Every content operation tracked for analytics
- **Engagement Analytics**: View and download tracking with completion rates
- **Access Attempt Logging**: Both successful and denied access attempts tracked
- **Error Context**: Comprehensive error scenarios with business context

### 3. Security Validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Malicious content ID handling (XSS, SQL injection attempts)
- **Access Token Security**: Proper expiration and verification patterns
- **Concurrent Access**: Consistent results under concurrent load
- **Data Isolation**: No information leakage between different users

## Platform Coverage Validation

### Artist Experience
- **Content Upload**: Complete file upload flow with validation
