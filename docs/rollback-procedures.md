# Rollback Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back deployments in case of
issues with the Direct-to-Fan Platform in production.

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

Before deploying to production, ensure the following preparations are in place:

1. **Database Backups**: Ensure automated backups are configured and a manual
   backup is taken before deployment
2. **Previous Deployment Information**: Document the current deployment ID and
   configuration
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for major changes to allow quick
   disabling without full rollback
4. **Deployment Window**: Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Ensure all monitoring systems are active and alerting
   is configured

## Rollback Decision Criteria

Consider a rollback if any of the following conditions are met:

1. **Critical Functionality Broken**: Core user flows (authentication, payments,
   content access) are not working
2. **Data Integrity Issues**: Deployment causes data corruption or inconsistency
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Deployment introduces or exposes security
   vulnerabilities
4. **Performance Degradation**: Significant performance degradation affecting
   user experience
5. **Payment Processing Failures**: Issues with payment processing or
   subscription management

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Immediate Mitigation

Before initiating a full rollback, consider these immediate mitigation steps:

1. **Enable Maintenance Mode**: If available, enable maintenance mode to prevent
   further issues
2. **Disable Feature Flags**: Turn off new features that may be causing issues
3. **Scale Up Resources**: Temporarily increase server resources if performance
   is the issue
4. **Emergency Hotfix**: For minor issues, deploy a quick fix rather than
   rolling back

### 2. Vercel Deployment Rollback

To roll back a Vercel deployment:

```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Roll back to a previous deployment
vercel rollback --scope <team-name> --prod
```

Alternatively, use the Vercel dashboard:

1. Navigate to the project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Find the last stable deployment
4. Click the three dots menu and select "Promote to Production"

### 3. Database Rollback

If database migrations need to be rolled back:

```bash
# Roll back the most recent migration
npx prisma migrate down 1

# Roll back to a specific migration
npx prisma migrate down --to <migration-name>
```

For more complex scenarios, restore from the pre-deployment backup:

1. Access the database management console
2. Restore the backup taken before deployment
3. Verify data integrity after restoration

### 4. Third-Party Service Configuration Rollback

#### Stripe Configuration

1. Access the Stripe Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Developers" > "Webhooks"
3. Restore previous webhook configurations if changed
4. Verify webhook signatures and endpoints

#### AWS S3/CloudFront

1. Access the AWS Management Console
2. Revert any bucket policy or CORS configuration changes
3. Roll back CloudFront distribution changes if needed

### 5. Environment Variables Rollback

To restore previous environment variables:

```bash
# List environment variables
vercel env ls

# Remove problematic environment variables
vercel env rm <VAR_NAME> production

# Add back previous values
vercel env add <VAR_NAME> production
```

## Post-Rollback Actions

After completing the rollback:

1. **Verify System Status**: Run system tests to ensure all critical
   functionality is working
2. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform team members and affected users about the
   rollback
3. **Document Issues**: Document the issues that led to the rollback
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the
   root cause
5. **Update Test Cases**: Add test cases to prevent similar issues in the future

## Monitoring During Rollback

During and after the rollback process, closely monitor:

1. **Error Rates**: Watch for any spikes in error rates
2. **API Response Times**: Monitor for performance degradation
3. **User Authentication**: Ensure users can log in and access their accounts
4. **Payment Processing**: Verify that payments and subscriptions are working
   correctly
5. **Content Delivery**: Check that content is being served correctly

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

1. **Slack Alert**: Post in the #deployments channel about the rollback
2. **Incident Response**: Create an incident in the incident management system
3. **Team Meeting**: Schedule a quick team meeting to coordinate rollback
   efforts

### External Communication

1. **Status Page**: Update the status page to inform users of the issue
2. **Email Notification**: For major issues, send an email to affected users
3. **Social Media**: For widespread issues, post a brief update on social media
   channels

## Recovery Plan

After a successful rollback:

1. **Fix Issues**: Address the issues that caused the rollback in a development
   environment
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Perform thorough testing of the fixed version
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider a phased deployment approach for the fixed
   version
4. **Post-Mortem**: Conduct a post-mortem analysis to prevent similar issues

## Rollback Drills

To ensure the team is prepared for rollbacks:

1. **Regular Practice**: Conduct rollback drills quarterly
2. **Documentation Updates**: Keep rollback procedures updated with system
   changes
3. **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand the rollback procedures
