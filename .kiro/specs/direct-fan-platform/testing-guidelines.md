# Testing Guidelines for Direct Fan Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and guidelines for the Direct Fan Platform. It covers end-to-end testing with Playwright, load testing, and best practices for ensuring application quality.

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

### Setup and Configuration

The project uses Playwright for end-to-end testing. The configuration is defined in `playwright.config.ts` at the root of the project.

To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Test Structure

E2E tests are organized in the `e2e` directory with the following structure:

```
e2e/
├── auth/              # Authentication tests
├── artist/            # Artist journey tests
├── fan/               # Fan journey tests
└── utils/             # Test utilities and helpers
```

### Critical User Journeys

The following critical user journeys are covered by E2E tests:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User signup (artist and fan)
   - User login
   - Validation errors
   - Logout

2. **Artist Journey**
   - Stripe Connect onboarding
   - Tier creation and management
   - Content upload and management
   - Analytics dashboard

3. **Fan Journey**
   - Artist discovery
   - Viewing artist profiles
   - Subscribing to tiers
   - Managing subscriptions
   - Accessing content
   - Commenting on content

### Best Practices for E2E Tests

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests.
2. **Realistic Data**: Use realistic test data that mimics production scenarios.
3. **Selectors**: Use data attributes for test selectors (e.g., `data-testid`, `data-tier-id`) rather than CSS classes or element text.
4. **Assertions**: Include meaningful assertions that verify the expected behavior.
5. **Timeouts**: Use appropriate timeouts for asynchronous operations.
6. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling in tests.
7. **Screenshots**: Configure screenshots on test failures for easier debugging.

## Load Testing

### Setup and Configuration

The project includes a custom load testing script in `scripts/load-test.js` that simulates concurrent users performing various actions on the platform.

To run load tests:

```bash
# Run with default settings (100 users, 60 seconds)
npm run test:load

# Run with custom settings
npm run test:load -- --users=200 --duration=120 --ramp-up=30 --target=https://staging.example.com
```

### Load Test Scenarios

The load testing script includes the following scenarios:

1. **Browse Home Page**: 40% of requests
2. **Discover Artists**: 20% of requests
3. **View Artist Profile**: 15% of requests
4. **Fan Dashboard**: 10% of requests
5. **Artist Dashboard**: 10% of requests
6. **View Content**: 5% of requests

### Performance Targets

Based on requirement 7.2 and 7.3, the application should:

- Respond within 2 seconds under typical load
- Support up to 10,000 concurrent users

Load tests should verify these targets are met.

## Automated Testing Pipeline

### CI/CD Integration

E2E tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with the following workflow:

1. **Pull Request**: Run a subset of critical E2E tests
2. **Main Branch**: Run the full E2E test suite
3. **Release**: Run E2E tests against staging environment

### Test Reports

Test reports are generated automatically and stored as artifacts in the CI/CD pipeline. They include:

- Test results summary
- Screenshots of failures
- Performance metrics
- Video recordings of test runs

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing New Tests

When adding new features, follow these guidelines for creating tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all business logic and utility functions
2. **Component Tests**: Test React components in isolation
3. **API Tests**: Test API endpoints with various inputs and edge cases
4. **E2E Tests**: Add E2E tests for critical user journeys

### Test Coverage

Aim for the following test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for business logic
- **Component Tests**: All UI components should have basic tests
- **API Tests**: All endpoints should have tests for success and error cases
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user journeys should be covered

### Debugging Failed Tests

When tests fail:

1. Check the test report for screenshots and videos
2. Review the console output for errors
3. Try running the test in debug mode (`npm run test:e2e:debug`)
4. Verify if the failure is due to test flakiness or actual bugs

### Handling Flaky Tests

For flaky tests:

1. Identify the cause of flakiness (timing issues, race conditions, etc.)
2. Add appropriate waits or retry logic
3. Consider isolating the test if it continues to be flaky

## Security Testing

Security testing is integrated into the testing process:

1. **Static Analysis**: Run security checks during CI/CD
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
3. **CSRF Protection**: Verify CSRF tokens are properly implemented
4. **Authentication**: Test authentication edge cases
5. **Authorization**: Verify proper access controls

## Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing ensures WCAG AA compliance:

1. **Automated Checks**: Run axe or similar tools in E2E tests
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all features with keyboard-only navigation
3. **Screen Reader**: Verify compatibility with screen readers
4. **Color Contrast**: Check for proper contrast ratios

## Conclusion

Following these testing guidelines will help ensure the Direct Fan Platform meets its quality, performance, and reliability requirements. Regular testing and continuous improvement of the test suite are essential for maintaining a high-quality application.
