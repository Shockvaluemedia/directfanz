# Security Implementation Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Direct Fan Platform to ensure compliance with OWASP best practices, GDPR requirements, and general security standards.

## 1. Security Headers

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented a comprehensive Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks
- CSP directives restrict which resources can be loaded and executed
- CSP violation reporting endpoint at `/api/security/csp-report`

### HTTP Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables browser XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls information in the Referer header
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts access to browser features
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS connections (production only)

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Security
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Secure cookie handling with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes
- CSRF protection for authentication endpoints
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- Password strength validation with minimum requirements

### Authorization Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for API endpoints
- Middleware for validating user permissions
- Principle of least privilege applied to all operations

## 3. Data Protection

### Encryption
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest using AES-256-CBC
- Secure key management for encryption/decryption operations
- All data transmitted over HTTPS

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Zod schema validation for all API inputs
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## 4. GDPR Compliance

### User Consent
- Cookie consent banner with granular consent options
- Privacy preferences management UI
- Consent tracking and enforcement

### Data Subject Rights
- Data export functionality (`/api/user/gdpr/export`)
- Account deletion functionality (`/api/user/gdpr/delete`)
- Data minimization principles applied throughout the application

## 5. API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Tiered rate limiting based on endpoint sensitivity:
  - General API: 100 requests per minute
  - Authentication: 10 requests per 15 minutes
  - Content access: 50 requests per minute
- IP-based rate limiting with configurable windows
- Proper rate limit headers and responses

### Request Validation
- Request ID tracking for all API requests
- Suspicious activity detection
- Comprehensive error handling with safe error messages

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

### Secure Error Handling
- Custom error classes with operational vs. programmer error distinction
- User-friendly error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- Development-only detailed error information

### Security Logging
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- Security event logging for authentication, authorization, and suspicious activities
- Integration with Sentry for error monitoring
- PII redaction in logs

## 7. Security Testing & Monitoring

### Automated Security Checks
- Security check script (`npm run security:check`)
- Pre-build security validation
- Checks for:
  - Hardcoded secrets
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - XSS vulnerabilities
  - Insecure random number generation
  - Eval usage
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - Environment file security
  - Security headers implementation
  - Authentication implementation
  - GDPR compliance

### Continuous Monitoring
- CSP violation monitoring
- Authentication failure monitoring
- Rate limit breach monitoring
- Suspicious activity detection

## 8. Third-Party Integrations

### Stripe Payment Security
- PCI compliance through Stripe integration
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure API key management

### AWS S3 Security
- Presigned URLs for secure file access
- Proper IAM permissions
- Content access validation

## 9. Security Best Practices

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- Security requirements in specifications
- Security-focused code reviews
- Regular dependency updates
- Security testing before deployment

### Security Headers Enforcement
- Security headers applied to all responses
- CSP implemented for all pages
- CORS configuration for API endpoints

## 10. Implementation Details

### Middleware Security
- The `middleware.ts` file implements:
  - Security headers for all responses
  - Rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Request/response logging
  - CORS handling

### Security Utilities
- The `security.ts` file provides:
  - Password validation
  - Secure token generation
  - Data encryption/decryption
  - CSRF token management
  - Input sanitization
  - GDPR data handling

### Error Boundary
- Global error boundary with secure error display
- Error tracking with Sentry
- User-friendly error pages

## 11. Future Enhancements

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Security headers reporting (Report-To, NEL)
- Advanced bot protection
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing
