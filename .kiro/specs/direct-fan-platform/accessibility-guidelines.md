# Accessibility Guidelines

This document outlines the accessibility standards and best practices implemented in the Direct-to-Fan Music Platform to ensure WCAG AA compliance.

## Overview

The platform follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and use the platform effectively. These guidelines cover a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible.

## Key Accessibility Features

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are visible and high contrast
- Focus order follows a logical sequence
- No keyboard traps
- Keyboard shortcuts for media players and common actions

**Implementation:**
- Use native HTML elements or ARIA roles with proper keyboard event handlers
- Ensure all buttons, links, and form controls can be accessed via Tab key
- Implement `tabIndex` appropriately (avoid positive values)
- Add visible focus styles that meet contrast requirements

### 2. Screen Reader Support

- Proper semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Alternative text for images
- Descriptive labels for form controls
- Live regions for dynamic content
- Announcements for state changes

**Implementation:**
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, etc.)
- Include proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` through `<h6>`)
- Add `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby` where appropriate
- Implement `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
- Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, and `aria-selected` for interactive elements

### 3. Color and Contrast

- Text meets minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text)
- UI components and graphical objects meet minimum contrast ratio of 3:1
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
- Focus indicators have sufficient contrast

**Implementation:**
- Use the contrast checker utility in `src/lib/accessibility.ts`
- Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Add additional indicators beyond color (icons, text, patterns)
- Test with grayscale mode to verify information is still understandable

### 4. Form Accessibility

- All form controls have associated labels
- Error messages are programmatically associated with form controls
- Form validation provides clear instructions
- Required fields are clearly indicated
- Error summary for form submissions

**Implementation:**
- Use the `AccessibleFormField` component from `src/components/ui/accessible-form.tsx`
- Associate error messages with inputs using `aria-describedby`
- Use `aria-invalid="true"` for fields with errors
- Provide error summaries with links to the corresponding fields

### 5. Media Accessibility

- Audio and video players have keyboard controls
- Captions for video content
- Audio descriptions where needed
- Transcripts for audio-only content
- No auto-playing media without user control

**Implementation:**
- Use the enhanced `VideoPlayer` and `AudioPlayer` components
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for media control
- Ensure media controls are properly labeled
- Support captions through the `<track>` element

### 6. Content Structure

- Proper heading hierarchy
- Landmark regions
- Skip links for navigation
- Consistent navigation
- Descriptive page titles

**Implementation:**
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement the `SkipLink` component from `src/components/ui/accessibility.tsx`
- Ensure each page has a unique, descriptive title
- Use ARIA landmarks where appropriate

### 7. Responsive Design and Zoom

- Content is responsive to viewport size
- Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- No horizontal scrolling at 320px viewport width
- Content works at 400% zoom

**Implementation:**
- Use relative units (rem, em) instead of fixed units (px)
- Test at various zoom levels and viewport sizes
- Ensure text containers expand with text size
- Implement responsive design patterns

## Testing Accessibility

### Automated Testing

- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Integrate accessibility tests into CI/CD pipeline
- Run automated tests on key user flows

### Manual Testing

- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- Color contrast verification
- Zoom and responsive testing

### Testing Tools

- axe DevTools (browser extension)
- WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
- Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
- Color contrast analyzers
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

## Accessibility Components

The platform includes several accessibility-focused components:

1. `src/components/ui/accessibility.tsx` - Core accessibility components:
   - `SkipLink` - Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation
   - `VisuallyHidden` - Content visible only to screen readers
   - `LiveRegion` - For dynamic content announcements
   - `FocusTrap` - For modal dialogs
   - `AccessibleIcon` - For icons with proper labels
   - `ErrorMessage` - For accessible error messages
   - `FormLabel` - For accessible form labels
   - `AccessibleTooltip` - For accessible tooltips
   - `AccessibleDialog` - For accessible modal dialogs

2. `src/components/ui/accessible-form.tsx` - Form accessibility components:
   - `AccessibleFormField` - Wraps form inputs with proper accessibility attributes
   - `AccessibleForm` - Provides form validation and accessibility features
   - `AccessibleErrorSummary` - Displays a summary of form errors
   - `useAccessibleForm` - Hook for managing form state with accessibility features

3. `src/lib/accessibility.ts` - Accessibility utilities:
   - `handleKeyboardNavigation` - Helper for keyboard event handling
   - `announceToScreenReader` - Creates accessible announcements
   - `useFocusTrap` - Hook for trapping focus in modals
   - `checkContrast` - Utility for checking color contrast
   - `meetsWCAGAA` - Checks if contrast meets WCAG AA standards
